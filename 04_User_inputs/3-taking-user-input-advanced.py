a = input("Enter first number: ")
a = int(a)

b = input("Enter second number: ")
b = int(b)

print("Summation: ",a+b)

#This is correct but there is a better way of doing this

c = int(input("Enter third number: "))
d = int(input("Enter fourth number: "))
print("Summation: ",c+d)
#this is a way of declaring that the input is integer
