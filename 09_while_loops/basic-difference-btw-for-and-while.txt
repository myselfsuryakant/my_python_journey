When to use for loop: When you know (or can easily determine) exactly how many times you need to repeat something, or when you want to iterate over every item in a sequence.
    Print numbers from 1 to 10. (Known range)
    Print each character in a name. (Iterate over all items in a string)
    Sum all numbers in a given list. (Iterate over all items in a list)

When to use while loop: When you don't know in advance how many times you need to repeat, but you have a condition that, when False, should stop the repetition.
    Keep asking for input until it's valid.
    Keep guessing until the correct number is found.
    Keep processing until a number becomes 1 (Collatz).
    Run a menu until the user chooses to exit.
